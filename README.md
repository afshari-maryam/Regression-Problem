# Regression-Problem
This project is about implementation of regression problem for Sleep Efficiency dataset from kaggle.</br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency </br>
This is what I have done for this project.</br>
Data loading and preprocessing:</br>
■ Identify features and labels</br>
■ Features:</br>
● Encoding data Categorical to numerical/ordinal </br>
● Identifying/correcting errors </br>
● Filling/removing missing values </br>
● Removing outliers </br>
● Transformation (Standardization/Normalization) </br>
● Visualize the features </br>
● Analyze relationships between features (correlation matrix)</br>
● Rank the features using PCA and Random forest </br>
● Use certain features not all the features (up to you to choose the
features) </br>
■ Labels </br>
● Calculate Central/Dispersion measures </br>
● Check the proportion of the target values in case of classification </br>
● Rebalance the dataset using resembling techniques </br>
■ Split the data into train and test (80-20)</br>
■ Use different base models</br>
■ Use grid search/random search </br>
■ Use ensembling techniques to see if there is any improvement in the
overall accuracy.</br>
■ Plot the test set using only two principal components </br>
■ Use the concept of pipeline for your machine learning modeling </br>
■ Communicate your results: </br>
● Explain the effect of each feature on the modeling process.</br>
● Report the best model.
