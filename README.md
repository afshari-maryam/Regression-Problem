# Regression-Problem
This project is about implementation of regression problem for Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset Kaggle. 
This is what I have done for this project.
Data loading and preprocessing:
■ Identify features and labels
■ Features:
● Encoding data Categorical to numerical/ordinal (if needed)
● Identifying/correcting errors (if needed)
● Filling/removing missing values (if needed)
● Removing outliers (if needed)
● Transformation (Standardization/Normalization)
● Visualize the features
● Analyze relationships between features (correlation matrix)
● Rank the features using PCA and Random forest
● Use certain features not all the features (up to you to choose the
features)
■ Labels
● Calculate Central/Dispersion measures
● Check the proportion of the target values in case of classification
● Rebalance the dataset using resembling techniques (if needed)
■ Split the data into train and test (80-20)
■ Use different base models
■ Use grid search/random search
■ Use ensembling techniques to see if there is any improvement in the
overall accuracy.
■ Plot the test set using only two principal components
■ Use the concept of pipeline for your machine learning modeling
■ Communicate your results:
● Explain the effect of each feature on the modeling process.
● Report the best model.
